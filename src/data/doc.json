{"opening1":"We need pathways to success that streamline the Black community's growth and provide resources to anyone who seeks careers in technology or entrepreneurship.","opening2":"But to properly build collaboration at a national level there needs to be a more clearly defined picture of what resources exist and what gaps the Black community should focus on first to leverage technology and entrepreneurship in an economically viable way.","intro":"The Black Innovation Alliance, working on Ecosystem Building at a national level, saw an opportunity to clarify what is currently happening in different ecosystems across the nation by working with the Center of Black Innovation to conduct a survey. We want to start understanding the contours of the support systems that exist around Black Founders and begin creating mechanisms that show how these Black organizations continue to grow and change.","placeHead":"Where are the organizations that support Black Founders and Technologist?","placeSub":"Physical location may seem to many to be of less value given all the zoom calls and the rise of remote work, but nothing beats that sense of community and the relationship building that is done in person. We were curious as to where Black Support Organizations operated.","place1":"Where a Black Innovators choose to operate can make a significant difference in the speed of their growth and whether they succeed at all. Black Innovators, Black Innovators who operate within Innovation Ecosystems as entrepreneurs or technologist, are a key part of the current push for more clearer pathways to greater economic mobility for the Black community. Creating a business and looking for employment that can result in a high paying career does not require an organization that is in that innovator’s city to specifically be present but it can greatly increase the opportunities that those Black innovators are presented with when they do run into roadblocks. Historically, to have any great success in the technology and innovation spaces Black Innovators needed to be located in California or New York but Black leaders have risen up to break that stigma. The creation various organizations that help Black Innovators create startups, transition into technology, and make investments into Black entities have been aptly named Black Innovation Ecosystems. This subset of the overall Innovation Ecosystem exists expressly to serve those Black Innovators seeking success in their respective pathways.","placeChartTitle1":"Landscape of Black Support Organizations","placeChartSub1":"Across the US Black Support Organizations have been growing in number to support the increased interest in Black Founders and Technical Professionals, particularly in Georgia, New York, and California. The goal is that these organizations transform anecdotes into entire communities of founders and technologist.","place2":"While organizations that support Black Innovators are not all together new, Black Support Organizations specifically focus on being a catalyst for Black Innovators as opposed to every aspect of the Black community. These organizations have been growing rapidly across the nation over the last decade, seemingly expanding with the increased attention to the technology and innovation fields from the Black community. While it is not clear exactly why there has been an explosion of Black Support Organizations, especially past 2015, many Black leaders have stepped up to create pathways for Black Innovators where gaps exists. Most crucially recognizing the lack of access to opportunities as opposed to the lack of skills or knowledge from these Black Innovators.","placeChartTitle2":"Most Black Support Organizations Were Founded After 2015","placeChartSub2":"The majority of Black Support Organizations were founded after 2015 with 2017 being a particularly popular year to start a BSO.","place3":"As Black Support Organizations are primarily located in large metropolitan areas there are many gaps that exist across the map that have large populations of Black people but do not have any direct connection to Black Support Organizations. For this reason many Black Support Organizations have opt to operate with a national scope to cover more Black communities. The likelihood that smaller cities will have the resources to support sustained resources specifically for Black Innovators is low, giving national Black Support Organizations greater utility to operate across several cities. Balancing local and national Black Support Organizations will be key to support a greater number of Black communities looking to leverage innovation for economic growth.","placeChartTitle3":"Reach of Black Support Organizations","placeChartSub3":"The majority of BSO have a national focus as described by their leaders, programming, or messaging. While certain types of organizations lend themselves to a more national audience, like a VC Firm, many have opted to have a national focus to attract stronger visibility and galvanize resources for the communities that they serve.","serHead":"How do Black Support Organizations serve their audiences?","serSub":"Diving deeper into the different kinds of BSOs allows us to get a better understanding of the type of services that these organizations offer different members within a Black Innovation Ecosystem. While many innovators do need capital and funding, many more innovators just need guidance and knowledge to better navigate these complex systems.","ser1":"Black Support Organizations come in a lot of different varieties depending on how they are grouped. One of the larger aims of this study was to better understand how Black Support Organizations describe themselves both through their external channels and the programs/actions they take for their constituents. Each of these organizations are seeking to solve a gap that exists within their respective ecosystems or nationally. As more intention is brought to collaboration and constructing ecosystems that specifically serve people in need.","serChartTitle1":"Accelerator and Incubator Organizations are the Most Frequently Recorded Types of Organizations.","serChartSub1":"The work that Workforce and Accelerator type organizations do is central to the largest and most visible innovators in a Black Innovation Ecosystem, Founders and Technologist. While that aligns with our ideas of properly distributed resources we cannot exclude SME support entities who can also play a larger role in shifting more of the Black community into Black Innovation Ecosystems.","ser2":"Black Innovation Ecosystems are covering a wide range of activities, companies, and pathways and require a variety of Black Support Organizations to provide resources to Black Innovators. Black entrepreneurs need to leverage accelerators, incubators, and investor connections to surpass systematic barriers preventing them from achieving high levels of visibility and success. On the other end of the spectrum Black Technologist need talent development and various associations to fast track them into career positions where they will be offered the opportunity to grow as well as advocate for the need for more Black leaders within the technology field itself. As Black Innovators grow as a group, Black Support Organizations will need to deepen and expand the services that they can offer to bring the Black community to a competitive level within the wider Innovation Ecosystem.","serChartTitle2":"All of the Most Frequently Mentioned Programs are Strictly Education Related.","serChartSub2":"Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.","innHead":"Who are the people that Black Support Organizations serve?","innSub":"Since Black Support Organizations primary work is to support Innovators creating full lives and wealth, a deeper understanding of what resources, environments, and financing will create clearer pathways to success.","inn1":"Taking a national approach to building up a Black Innovation Ecosystems requires deciding if Black Support Organizations should be built in locations where Black Innovators are currently finding success or where the densest population of Black people exist. The hope with the latter is to spur the growth Black communities with a lack of opportunities instead of focusing on those locations that are already seeing steady growth. As with most complex problems the answer will be a mixture of both but deciding which route to tackle first based on limited resources will alter how these Black communities grow in the long term.","innChartTitle1":"Black Companies and Black Support Organizations are not completely in sync.","innChartSub1":"Locations like California, New York, Georgia, and Texas align fairly well when comparing funded Black companies to Black Support Organizations but as we look deeper there are mis-matches in available resources and funding success. Part of this is due to the growing identification of Black Support Organizations but the other side are opportunities to create stronger ecosystems for Black Innovators.","inn2":"As this entire piece has been concerned with Black Innovators and Black communities it could be assumed that Black Support Organizations exist only to serve the needs of Black Innovators. Although, one of the most interesting insights from this study has been Black Support Organizations’ audience predominately covering People of Color not just Black people. Knowing that these gaps and lack of resources are systematic puts Black leaders in the position of solving these problems to effect multiple communities that are effected by the same problems at different levels. As Black Support Organizations grow, looking at their work within other underserved communities alongside Black communities will give a more realistic look into the impact they create.","innChartTitle2":"Ethnic Breakdown of Service","innChartSub2":"While not vastly outweighing the organizations that focus on just Black Innovators the majority of the organizations we collected data on held their services open to all People of Color.","conclusion":"The Black Innovation Alliance, working on Ecosystem Building at a national level, saw an opportunity to clarify what is currently happening in different ecosystems across the nation by working with the Center of Black Innovation to conduct a survey.","conChartTitle":"Enter Your Organization!","conChartSub":"Below is an active list of the organizations that we have in our database.
